An amazing CRUD API generator for Express and Mongoose.

Creating a rest API with Mongoose and ExpressJS has never been easier.

Thanks to APIATO you can create a REST API or a microservice for your projects in minutes and with a lot of features, in
the easiest way you can imagine.

APIATO is a helper that allows you from the ExpressJS router to create a basic CRUD based on standardized HTTP requests.

It has the main operations of a CRUD, but enhanced to the maximum, offering the possibility of strengthening your query
from the use of parameters and searches from the client.

APIATO can be easily integrated with ExpressJS. to be used in monolithic projects, microservices, or to be consumed
through a gateway.

In APIATO you can use any of the following functions independently or simultaneously.

* createOne (The way to create a new item in a collection)
* createMany (The way to create multiple items in a collection)
* getMany (Get multiple items from a collection)
* getOneById (Get an item from the collection by ID)
* getOneWhere (Get an item from the collection through a search)
* findUpdateOrCreate (Find an element, and edit it; In case of not finding it, create the new element in the collection)
* findUpdate (Find an item and edit it in a collection)
* updateById (Find an item by ID and edit it)
* findIdAndDelete (Find an item by ID and delete it)
* datatable (support for mongoose-datatables-fork plugin)

And this is not all within those functions and through parameters that can be sent mainly in the query of the URL you
can.

* Populate one or more fields
* Select the fields you want to return only
* Paginate an item
* Apply filters and searches (by objectID, value, and% LIKE%)
* Sort items and much more.
